🎮 Hangman Game Description
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that is both fun and educational. It is often played with pencil and paper or as a computer game.

🧠 Objective:
The goal of the game is to guess the hidden word or phrase by suggesting letters within a limited number of incorrect attempts.

🕹️ How to Play:
A word is chosen secretly by the game (or one player).

The word is displayed as a series of blank spaces, one for each letter.

Example: The word "apple" is shown as _ _ _ _ _

The player guesses one letter at a time.

If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct position(s).

Guess: "p" → _ p p _ _

If the guess is wrong, a part of a hangman figure is drawn.

The player has a limited number of wrong guesses (usually 6 or 7) before the entire hangman is drawn and the game is lost.

✅ Win Condition:
The player guesses all the letters in the word correctly before reaching the maximum number of wrong guesses.

❌ Lose Condition:
The player reaches the maximum number of incorrect guesses, and the hangman drawing is completed.
